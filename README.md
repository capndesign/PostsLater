# About

This is a Movable Type plugin that optimizes the order of your scheduled posts. In other words, it figures out the best time for you to future-publish a post based on a few criteria.

# Specs

Since we've obviously got nothing else here right now, I'm going to update this about doc with specs.

## Settings

* Entries per day
* Posting start time
* Posting end time
* Posting days (Checkboxes next to all 7 days)
* Give weight to beginning/middle/end of day

## Entry Listing Actions

* Evenly distribute scheduled posts
** This should take all scheduled posts yet to publish and evenly disperse their posting times based on the settings provided
** After clicking the action, it should take you to a batch edit screen showing the proposed times, let you edit them manually if you'd like and then save the new values

## Entry Permalink Page

* A button to change the entry date to the next available slot
* A sidebar module that shows the next 10 scheduled entries (should display title and entry date)
